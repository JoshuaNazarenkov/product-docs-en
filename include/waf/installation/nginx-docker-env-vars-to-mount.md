Environment variable | Description| Required
--- | ---- | ----
`DEPLOY_USER` | Email to the **Deploy** or **Administrator** user account in Wallarm Console.| Yes
`DEPLOY_PASSWORD` | Password to the **Deploy** or **Administrator** user account in Wallarm Console. | Yes
`WALLARM_API_HOST` | Wallarm API server:<ul><li>`us1.api.wallarm.com` for the US Cloud</li><li>`api.wallarm.com` for the EU Cloud</li></ul>By default: `api.wallarm.com`. | No
`DEPLOY_FORCE` | Replaces an existing Wallarm node with a new one if an existing Wallarm node name matches the identifier of the container you are running. The following values can be assigned to a variable:<ul><li>`true` to replace the filtering node</li><li>`false` to disable the replacement of the filtering node</li></ul>Default value (if the variable is not passed to the container) is `false`.<br>The Wallarm node name always matches the identifier of the container you are running. Filtering node replacement is helpful if the Docker container identifiers in your environment are static and you are trying to run another Docker container with the filtering node (for example, a container with a new version of the image). If in this case the variable value is `false`, the filtering node creation process will fail. | No
