To stop sending reports and notifications temporarily, you can disable the integration:

1. Go to Wallarm Console → **Settings** → **Integrations** in the [US](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/settings/integrations/) or [EU](https://my.wallarm.com/settings/integrations/) Cloud.
2. Open an active integration and click **Disable**.

To re-enable sending reports and notifications, open the disabled integration and click **Enable**.

Disabling the integration is the system event. If you receive system notifications, messages about disabled integration will be sent to the [configured system](integrations-intro.md#integration-types).
