To stop sending reports and notifications permanently, you can delete the integration. Deleting an integration cannot be undone. The integration will be removed from the list permanently.

1. Go to your Wallarm account → **Settings** → **Integrations** in the [EU](https://my.wallarm.com/settings/integrations/) or [US](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/settings/integrations/) cloud.
2. Open integration and click **Delete**.
3. Confirm the action.

Deleting the integration is the system event. If you receive system notifications, messages about deleted integration will be sent to the [configured system](integrations-intro.md#integration-types).
