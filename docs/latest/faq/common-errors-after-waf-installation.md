# Errors after Wallarm node installation

## File Download Scenarios Fail

If your file download scenarios fail after installing a filter node, the issue is in the request size exceeding the limit set in the `client_max_body_size` directive in the Wallarm configuration file.

Change the value in `client_max_body_size` in the directive `location` for the address that accepts the file uploads. Changing only the `location` value protects the main page from getting large requests.

Change the value in `client_max_body_size`:

1. Open for editing the configuration file in the `/etc/nginx-wallarm` directory.
2. Put in the new value:

	```
	location /file/upload {
	 client_max_body_size 16m;
	}
	```

	* `/file/upload` is the address that accepts the file uploads.

Detailed directive description is available in the [official NGINX documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size).

## How to fix the errors "signature could not be verified for wallarm-node", "yum doesn't have enough cached data to continue"?

If GPG keys for Wallarm RPM packages are expired, you may get the following error messages:

```
https://repo.wallarm.com/centos/wallarm-node/7/2.18/x86_64/repodata/repomd.xml:
[Errno -1] repomd.xml signature could not be verified for wallarm-node_2.18

One of the configured repositories failed (Wallarm Node for CentOS 7 - 2.18),
and yum doesn't have enough cached data to continue.
```

To fix the problem, please follow the steps:

1. Remove the previously added repository using the command:

	```bash
	sudo yum remove wallarm-node-repo
	```
2. Add a new repository using the command for appropriate CentOS and Wallarm node versions:

	=== "CentOS 7.x или Amazon Linux"
		```bash
		# Filtering node and postanalytics module of the 3.2 version
		sudo rpm -i https://repo.wallarm.com/centos/wallarm-node/7/3.2/x86_64/Packages/wallarm-node-repo-1-6.el7.noarch.rpm

		# Filtering node and postanalytics module of the 3.4 version
		sudo rpm -i https://repo.wallarm.com/centos/wallarm-node/7/3.4/x86_64/Packages/wallarm-node-repo-1-6.el7.noarch.rpm

		# Filtering node and postanalytics module of the 3.6 version
		sudo rpm -i https://repo.wallarm.com/centos/wallarm-node/7/3.6/x86_64/Packages/wallarm-node-repo-1-6.el7.noarch.rpm
		```
	=== "CentOS 8.x (deprecated starting with Wallarm node 3.6)"
		```bash
		# Filtering node and postanalytics module of the 3.2 version
		sudo rpm -i https://repo.wallarm.com/centos/wallarm-node/8/3.2/x86_64/Packages/wallarm-node-repo-1-6.el8.noarch.rpm

		# Filtering node and postanalytics module of the 3.4 version
		sudo rpm -i https://repo.wallarm.com/centos/wallarm-node/8/3.4/x86_64/Packages/wallarm-node-repo-1-6.el8.noarch.rpm
		```

## Why does not the filtering node block attacks when operating in blocking mode (`wallarm_mode block`)?

Using the `wallarm_mode` directive is only one of several methods of traffic filtration mode configuration. Some of these configuration methods have a higher priority than the `wallarm_mode` directive value.

If you have configured blocking mode via `wallarm_mode block` but Wallarm filtering node does not block attacks, please ensure that filtration mode is not overridden using other configuration methods:

* Using the [rule **Set traffic filtration mode**](../user-guides/rules/wallarm-mode-rule.md)
* In the [**General** section of Wallarm Console](../user-guides/settings/general.md)
