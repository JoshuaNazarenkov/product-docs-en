# Dashboards Overview

The **Dashboards** section on your Wallarm account shows the event history's graphs and metrics of the system, as well as the current status of resources. Data is displayed on two dashboards:

* [API Security dashboard](waf.md) with statistics on the filtering node operation

    ![! API Security dashboard](../../images/user-guides/dashboard/dashboard-waf.png)
* [Scanner Dashboard](scanner.md) with statistics on the detected vulnerabilities

    ![! Dashboard Scanner](../../images/user-guides/dashboard/dashboard-scanner.png)

    The **Onboarding tour** option will provide you with deployment options supported by Wallarm and links to relevant deployment instructions.
