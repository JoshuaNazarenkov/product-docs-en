# Wallarm API request examples

The following are some examples of Wallarm API use. You can also generate code examples via the API Reference UI for the [US cloud](https://apiconsole.us1.wallarm.com/) or [EU cloud](https://apiconsole.eu1.wallarm.com/). Experienced users can also use the browser’s Developer console (“Network” tab) to quickly learn which API endpoints and requests are used by the UI of your Wallarm account to fetch data from the public API. To find information about how to open the Developer console, you can use the official browser documentation ([Safari](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-the-developer-tools-in-the-develop-menu-sfri20948/mac), [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/), [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools), [Vivaldi](https://help.vivaldi.com/article/developer-tools/)).

## Get the first 50 attacks detected in the last 24 hours

## Get the first 50 incidents confirmed in the last 24 hours

The request is very similar to the previous example for a list of attacks; the `"!vulnid": null` term is added to this request. This term instructs the API to ignore all attacks without specified vulnerability ID, and this is how the system distinguishes between attacks and incidents.

Please replace `TIMESTAMP` with the date 24 hours ago converted to the [Unix Timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) format.

## Create a rule to block all requests with specific values of HOST and X-FORWARDED-FOR request headers

For domain `MY.DOMAIN.COM` the rule will block all requests besides one having IP address `44.33.22.11` in the value of `X-FORWARDED-FOR` HTTP request header.
