# Running API Firewall on Docker

This guide walks through downloading, installing, and starting Wallarm API Firewall on Docker.

## Requirements

* [Installed and configured Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) developed for the REST API of the application that should be protected with Wallarm API Firewall


## Step 1. Create the Docker network

To allow the containerized application and API Firewall communication without manual linking, create a separate [Docker network](https://docs.docker.com/network/) by using the command `docker network create`. The application and API Firewall containers will be linked to this network.

For example, to create the Docker network named `api-firewall-network`:

```bash
docker network create api-firewall-network
```

## Step 2. Start the containerized application

Start the containerized application that should be protected with API Firewall by using the command `docker run` and passing the created network name in the option `--network`.

For example, to start the [kennethreitz/httpbin](https://hub.docker.com/r/kennethreitz/httpbin/) Docker container connected to the `api-firewall-network` and assigned with the `backend` [network alias](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#ip-address-and-hostname) on the port 8090:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --network api-firewall-network \
    --network-alias backend -p 8090:8090 kennethreitz/httpbin
```

## Step 3. Start API Firewall

Start the pulled API Firewall image by using the command `docker run` and passing API Firewall configuration in the environment variables as described below.

For example, to start API Firewall connected to the `api-firewall-network` [network](https://docs.docker.com/network/) and assigned with the `api-firewall` [network alias](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#ip-address-and-hostname) on the port 8088:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --network api-firewall-network --network-alias api-firewall \
    -v <HOST_PATH_TO_SPEC>:<CONTAINER_PATH_TO_SPEC> -e APIFW_API_SPECS=<PATH_TO_MOUNTED_SPEC> \
    -e APIFW_URL=<API_FIREWALL_URL> -e APIFW_SERVER_URL=<PROTECTED_APP_URL> \
    -e APIFW_REQUEST_VALIDATION=<REQUEST_VALIDATION_MODE> -e APIFW_RESPONSE_VALIDATION=<RESPONSE_VALIDATION_MODE> \
    -p 8088:8088 wallarm/api-firewall:v0.6.4
```

**With the `-v` option**, please mount the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) to the API Firewall container directory:
    
* `HOST_PATH_TO_SPEC`: the path to the OpenAPI 3.0 specification for your application REST API located on the host machine. The accepted file formats are YAML and JSON (`.yaml`, `.yml`, `.json` file extensions). For example: `/opt/my-api/openapi3/swagger.json`.
* `<CONTAINER_PATH_TO_SPEC>`: the path to the container directory to mount the OpenAPI 3.0 specification to. For example: `/api-firewall/resources/swagger.json`.

**With the `-e` option**, please set the API Firewall configuration through the following environment variables:

You can specify several status codes separated by a semicolon (e.g. `404;401`). The default value is `404`.<br><br>By default, API Firewall operating in the `LOG_ONLY` mode for both the requests and responses marks all endpoints that are not included in the specification and are returning the code different from `404` as the shadow ones. | No

## Step 4. Test API Firewall operation

To test API Firewall operation, send the request that does not match the mounted Open API 3.0 specification to the API Firewall Docker container address. For example, you can pass the string value in the parameter that requires the integer value.

If the request does not match the provided API schema, the appropriate ERROR message will be added to the API Firewall Docker container logs.

## Step 5. Enable traffic on API Firewall

To finalize the API Firewall configuration, please enable incoming traffic on API Firewall by updating your application deployment scheme configuration. For example, this would require updating the Ingress, NGINX, or load balancer settings.
