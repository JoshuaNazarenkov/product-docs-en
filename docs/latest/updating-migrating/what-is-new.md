# What is new in WAF node 3.0

We have released WAF node 3.0 that is **totally incompatible with previous WAF node versions**. Before updating the modules up to 3.0, please carefully review the list of WAF node 3.0 changes listed below and [general recommendations](general-recommendations.md).

## Which WAF nodes are recommended to be updated?

* We do NOT recommend updating [partner WAF node](../partner-waf-node/overview.md) up to version 3.0, since most changes will be fully supported in partner WAF node [3.2](versioning-policy.md#version-list).
* Regular (client) WAF node can be updated up to version 3.0. Before updating the modules, we recommend to carefully review the list of WAF node 3.0 changes listed below and [other recommendations](general-recommendations.md).

## Changes in supported installation platforms

* Dropped support for the operating system Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial)

[See the full list of supported platforms →](../admin-en/supported-platforms.md)

## Changes in supported WAF node configuration parameters

* Dropped support for all `acl` NGINX directives, Envoy parameters, and environment variables used to configure IP addresses blacklist. Manual configuration of IP blacklisting is no longer required.

    [Details on migrating blacklist configuration →](migrate-ip-lists-to-node-3.md)

* Added new NGINX directive and Envoy parameter `disable_acl`. This parameter allows to disabled request origin analysis.

    [Details on the `disable_acl` NGINX directive →](../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#disable_acl)

    [Details on the `disable_acl` Envoy parameter →](../admin-en/configuration-guides/envoy/fine-tuning.md#basic-settings)

## Changes in system requirements for the WAF node installation

Starting with version 3.0, the WAF node supports IP addresses [whitelists, blacklists, and greylists](../user-guides/ip-lists/overview.md). The Wallarm Console allows adding both single IPs and **countries** or **data centers** to any IP list type.

The WAF node downloads an actual list of IP addresses registered in whitelisted, blacklisted, or greylisted countries or data centers from GCP storage. By default, access to this storage can be restricted in your system. Allowing access to GCP storage is a new requirement for the virtual machine on which the WAF node is installed.

## New features

* Support for new [filtration mode](../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md) `safe_blocking` and [IP addresses greylist](../user-guides/ip-lists/greylist.md).

    The WAF node operating in `safe_blocking` mode blocks only those malicious requests originated from greylisted IP addresses that allow a significant reduction of [false positives](../about-wallarm-waf/protecting-against-attacks.md#false-positives) numbers.
* New reaction of triggers **Add to greyist** allowing to automatically greylist IP addresses originated a specific number of malicious requests.

    [Example of the trigger that greylists IP addresses →](../user-guides/triggers/trigger-examples.md#greylist-ip-if-4-or-more-attack-vectors-are-detected-in-1-hour)
* Management of [IP addresses whitelist](../user-guides/ip-lists/whitelist.md) via the Wallarm Console.
* Automated whitelisting of [Wallarm Vulnerability Scanner](../about-wallarm-waf/detecting-vulnerabilities.md#vunerability-scanner) IP addresses. Manual whitelisting of Scanner IP addresses is no longer required.
* New parameters of the file `node.yaml` for configuring the synchronization of the Wallarm Cloud and WAF nodes: `api.local_host` and `api.local_port`. New parameters allow specifying a local IP address and port of the network interface through which requests to Wallarm API are sent.

    [See the full list of `node.yaml` parameters for Wallarm Cloud and WAF node synchronization setup →](../admin-en/configure-cloud-node-synchronization-en.md#credentials-to-access-the-wallarm-cloud)
* Ability to whitelist, blacklist, or greylist a subnet, Tor network IPs, VPN IPs, a group of IP addresses registered in a specific country or data center.

    [Details on adding IPs to the whitelist, blacklist, and greylist →](../user-guides/ip-lists/overview.md)
* New module **API Discovery** that automatically identifies the application API structure.

    [Details on the API Discovery module →](../about-wallarm-waf/api-discovery.md)

## Update process

1. Review [recommendations for the modules update](general-recommendations.md).
2. Update installed modules following the instructions for your WAF node deployment option:

      * [General recommendations for a safe WAF node update process](general-recommendations.md)
      * [Updating modules for NGINX, NGINX Plus, Kong](nginx-modules.md)
      * [Updating the Docker container with the modules for NGINX or Envoy](docker-container.md)
      * [Updating NGINX Ingress controller with integrated Wallarm WAF](ingress-controller.md)
      * [Cloud WAF node image](cloud-image.md)
3. [Migrate](migrate-ip-lists-to-node-3.md) whitelists and blacklists configuration from previous WAF node versions to 3.0
